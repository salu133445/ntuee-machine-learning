# Machine Learning (NTU EE 5177, 2016 Fall)

This repository contains assignments and final project for the course "Machine Learning" (NTU EE 5177, 2016 Fall).

## Assignments

1. PM2.5 prediction 
   - Topics: supervised learning, linear regression
   - Experiments: optimizer, regularization, learning rate
2. Spam classification
   - Topics: supervised learning, logistic regression, naive Bayes classifier
   - Experiments: discriminative vs generative models
3. Image classification
   - Topics: semi-supervised learning, convolutional neural network, self-training, autoencoder
   - Experiments: supervised vs semi-supervised vs unsupervised learning
4. StackOverflow titles classification
   - Topics: unsupervised learning, k-means clustering, dimensionality reduction, t-SNE visualization
   - Experiments: text features extractions (bag-of-words, tf-idf, latent semantic analysis, stop words)

## Final project

- Topic: Cyber security attack defender
- Models: multilayer perceptron (MLP), support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF)
- Experiments:
  - MLP: number of hidden nodes per layer, number of layers, dropout layer, activation function, batch size
  - RF: find out most significant features using random forest models
